# Dessert Finder

Dessert Finder is a proof of concept take-home coding exercise being worked on by Charles Fiedler. 
It takes a simple task, fetch JSON data provided by a few open-source API calls, use your knowledge of iOS development best practices to decode that data into a usable format, and make it look presentable for the user. When building this project, a spent a few extra hours here and there to avoid accomplishing the task in the fastest way, and instead implementing data decoding logic and UI design that I can be proud of.
